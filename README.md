illustration:  
I would like to explain that the script software was written in C++. The principle is to recognize changes in the game screen and simulate controlling the mouse and keyboard to perform player like operations, which is different from the way of directly reading and controlling the game, so please do not worry about being detected. The functions are still being continuously improved. If you need them, you can contact me to add the features you want.If any bugs are found, please point them out and I will fix them
